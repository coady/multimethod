# Contributing to `multimethod`
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Reporting bugs
The project uses GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/coady/multimethod/issues).

Please isolate the issue to the smallest reproducible example, with no dependencies. Most dispatch errors are caused by an unsupported type - one that does not implement `issubclass` correctly.

The bug report template has specific suggestions on how to check if a type is compatible.

## Feature Requests
Feel free to open a new [discussion](https://github.com/coady/multimethod/discussions) for ideas, or an issue for concrete proposals.

## Contributing to code
Contributions are welcome, though note that the code base is small and typically feature-complete. Starting with an issue is helpful.
